## Presentation Layer

This is the application that runs and communicates with the user. It depends on the Application Layer but configure all the layers properly. This may differ a liitle for other presentation layer (such as using a console application) but it should not be much of a hassle.

Migrations are found here - (I hope to move it to the Persistence layer) any Idea would be appreciated
